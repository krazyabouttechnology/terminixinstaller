# Terminix Installer
Installer/Updater Script for Terminix 

Terminix is a great GTK3 based tiling terminal emulator created by Gerald Nunn and is available at:

https://github.com/gnunn1/terminix.

This script is to automate the downloading and installing process of Terminix directly from Github. It will detect any installed versions of Terminix, compare the version with latest online available version and download and install it if its newer.

Requires sudo.

I created this for personal use and am publishing it for interested folks. It works well on Fedora and OpenSUSE. Rest of the distros....check it out yourself and let me know. :)

No installation is needed. Download the script, do a chmod to make it executable and run it.

Cheers!
